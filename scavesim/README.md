# SCAVESIM

Study of topological structures and their impact on search problems driven by [mobile agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_agent). Mobile agents can have direct communication (e.g., [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) or controller-driven communication) or [indirect communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised_system). Inter-agent communication mechanism, using [whiteboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised_system#Artificial_intelligence_and_robotics), is also explored. When using the whiteboard model, each agent has a local storage area where information can be written and read. Each such whiteboard is accessible in fair mutual exclusion to all incoming agents. Likewise, agent communication can follow a token model, in which agents have available a bounded number of tokens that can be carried, placed in a node and/or on a port of the node, or removed from them. Tokens are identical (i.e., indistinguishable tokens) and no other form of communication or coordination is available to the agents. Our simulations explore the complexity and impact of each of those communication models in terms of [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence).
